====================

==== Baggage essentials =====
=== Restricted and prohibited items ===
Many items are restricted, controlled or completely prohibited onboard our aircraft due to international law, aircraft safety or regulations at your destination.

Always check local country, airport and airline rules before you fly.

In the UK – Check with the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).

In the US – Check with the Transport Security Administration (TSA).

You must contact us in advance if you need clarification of the regulations or require airline approval when planning to travel with restricted or controlled items.

==== Liquids, creams, powders and aerosols ====
You can take these items on the plane in your checked baggage, but most countries have restrictions on the types and quantity you may take into the cabin in your hand baggage.

You are strongly advised to check the hand baggage requirements below that contain important security information.
=== Hand baggage requirements for liquids and powders ===
== Liquids ==
Each liquid must be in its own container, measuring no more than 100ml (3.4oz).
All liquids must be put in a single, transparent, re-sealable plastic bag of up to 20 x 20cm (8 x 8in) with a total capacity of up to 1 litre approx. 1 quart.
You must be able to completely close the bag and fit it in your hand baggage.
You may have to take the bag of liquids out of your hand baggage to be screened separately.
Aerosols can be carried in cabin bags but cannot be used on board due to the enclosed space.
In the UK and EU, liquids, aerosols or gels are screened using special equipment and you may be asked to open them. Taste or skin tests of these items are no longer carried out.
Some UK airports have installed advanced imaging scanners that allow you to leave liquids in your hand baggage when going through airport security. You won’t be able to choose your lane, so please follow the directions of airport security staff and be ready to comply with current UK Government requirements when travelling through any UK airport security point as these could change at short notice.
For flights outside the UK and EU, please check the current safety and security requirements of the country you’re travelling to.
Kenya has a strict ban on plastic bags in the country, so we recommend you travel with your liquids in a thicker, clear, re-useable polyurethane bag that fits the 20cm x 20cm maximum dimensions and seals closed. If you use a disposable plastic bag, discard it on board the flight or at a customs check point on arrival. The airport security area will have small liquids bags available for your journey out the country.

== Powders ==
If you’re flying to the US, you can carry up to 350g (12 oz) of powdered goods in your hand baggage. This includes items like cosmetics, spices, powdered milk, flour, sugar and coffee. Passengers who wish to travel with more than this must pack these items into their checked baggage.
If you're flying from Australia, any inorganic powders in hand baggage must be carried in containers that do not exceed 350ml (12 oz) or 350g (12 oz) per person.

=== Toiletries, aerosols medicines and medical supplies in hold baggage ==
You can take the following items, for personal use, in your checked baggage:
Toiletry items and aerosols such as hairsprays, perfumes and colognes.
Non-flammable, non-toxic aerosols for home or sporting use.
Medicines (non-radioactive), including those containing alcohol.
== How much can you take? ==

Under the IATA’s (International Air Transport Association) Dangerous Goods regulations, each person may carry the below weights in their baggage.

Weight per individual item: Max 500g (1lb)
Weight per person: 2kg (4 ½lbs)
Volume per individual item: Max 500ml (17fl. oz)
Volume per person: 2 litres (70fl. oz)
You must ensure the seals and lids on toiletries and medicines are secure, and spray valves on any aerosols are protected to prevent accidental release of the contents into your baggage in the aircraft hold.

== Medical supplies ==
If you’re travelling with essential liquid medical supplies like dialysis fluid, that’s packed in a separate bag and checked into the hold, you're able to take more than the standard amount listed above. To do this, you’ll need an official medical letter signed and dated by your personal medical practitioner.

=== Alcoholic drinks ==== 
There's no limit on the number of alcoholic beverages you can travel with as long as their alcohol volume is below 24%.

You can bring up to five litres of alcohol with an alcohol volume between 24% and 70%. This can travel in your cabin bag if you purchased it in the airport duty-free shop, or you can pack in your checked baggage.

Drinks above 70% alcohol volume are not permitted on board our aircraft in either checked baggage or hand baggage.

Please see the hand baggage requirements section above for information about taking liquids in your hand baggage through the security check areas.

=== Duty-free and airport purchases when connecting ===
You can buy duty-free liquids, gels or cream products of more than 100ml from airport shops or on board when you have a connecting flight, provided that they have been sealed at the point of purchase in a Security Tamper Evident Bag with the receipt inside. If you buy items on board, please ask cabin crew to do this for you.

If you want to leave the airport and return later for your connecting flight, you can take these items with you as long as you don't open the sealed bag. You will then need to go through security again, where airport staff might need to open and reseal your items in a new bag. We cannot accept liability for any products opened or confiscated during transit or disembarkation.

Please check the arrangements for all the airports on your journey to be certain what you can take in your hand baggage.

Any items you buy at the airport or on board count towards your hand baggage allowance for your next flight. If you exceed this, you may need to check the items in and be charged a fee.

=== Food and infant milk === 

You can take solid foods like sandwiches, biscuits, fruit, nuts, etc. on board but the same restrictions for liquids apply to liquid foods, e.g. drinks, soups, sauces, jam or jelly (see guidance above). Be aware that there are no facilities to warm or refrigerate anything that you bring onboard.

We don’t serve peanuts on board our flights, due to the number of customers with allergies, and we ask that you do not bring them into the cabin.

=== Infant milk and baby food === 

If you are travelling with an infant, you are allowed to carry as much infant milk, baby food, powdered milk formula and sterilised water, stored in a baby bottle, as required for your trip, even if this exceeds the usual limit on liquids.

These specific items do not need to fit in the transparent bag for presenting liquids as you go through search points, but you should have them ready for inspection by airport security.

Some airports, including Heathrow Airport, have a policy that permits parents to travel with up to 2 litres of liquid expressed breast milk in transparent containers, even when they're travelling without their baby.

Bringing food into other countries

The country of your destination may restrict the types of food allowed into the country, e.g. meat, fresh fruit and vegetables are forbidden by many countries.

For information on what food you can bring into the UK, visit the UK government website.

=== Insulated packaging with liquid nitrogen === 
In accordance with the IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations 2.3.5.10 this item does not require operator approval. You can take insulated packaging containing refrigerated liquid nitrogen (dry shipper) in your hand or checked baggage. It needs to be fully absorbed in a porous material and only contain non-dangerous goods.

==== Batteries, electric and electronic devices ==== 
=== Smaller personal electronic devices with lithium ion/metal batteries === 
For your own personal use you can take up to 15 battery-operated Personal Electronic Devices (PED) that containing lithium batteries such as laptops, tablets, smart phones, cameras, music players, smart baggage tags (e.g. Apple AirTag).

Please always ensure that:
All battery-powered devices are packed to prevent accidental activation.
Spare batteries are protected from short circuits and damage by keeping them in their original packaging (if possible), in a protective case or a strong plastic bag, or by placing electrical tape over the terminals and carried in the cabin.
You don't take any damaged batteries or electrical equipment with you.
Please note: If the watt hour (Wh) rating is not shown on the battery or cannot be determined, then the battery cannot be accepted onboard. You can use the following formula to calculate the Wh rating:
Milliamp hour rating/1000 multiplied by the voltage equals Wh.

=== Batteries of up to 100Wh as used in mobile phones, laptops, digital cameras etc. === 
In hand baggage

Must be kept in the device.
Max. 4 spares per person (incl. power banks) kept in original packaging or insulated/protected from contact with metal.

If you want to take your device in your hand baggage, you can rebook to a later flight but will then need to ensure that it is charged ahead of your new flight. A fee might apply for changing your booking, subject to your ticket type.
Items not allowed on our aircraft will be held by Bagport, who operate the lost property office in London Heathrow. You will be given a Bagport reference so that you can contact them directly for details of how to retrieve your item through their MailAndFly service.
If you're travelling from London Gatwick or a non-UK airport, please contact our customer services team at the airport who can advise on available options.

=== Smart Baggage === 
Smart Baggage is a bag (rucksack, suitcase or similar) that contains a detachable lithium battery/power bank used to recharge Personal Electronic Devices (PEDs) i.e. mobile phones, tablets, laptops etc. These bags, with specific restrictions, are allowed on our aircraft if the battery is removable.

This doesn’t include electric powered ride-on baggage (such as Airwheels baggage), where a lithium battery is used to provide electromotive power to propel the suitcase. These are not considered Smart baggage and are NOT permitted on our aircraft, either checked in as hold baggage or as cabin baggage.

If any fitted lithium battery/power bank for recharging devices cannot be detached from the bag by the customer, the Smart Bag will not be accepted on the flight.

If you can easily detach the lithium battery/power bank, the Smart Bag is permitted for carriage, subject to the following conditions:

In the cabin as hand baggage:

If the Smart Baggage is to be carried in the cabin, the lithium battery/power bank must be detached and:

Lithium battery/power banks up to and including 100Wh can remain in the bag.
Lithium battery/power banks of more than 100Wh up to 160Wh: These must be detached from the bag and protected from accidental activation with terminals insulated/protected from short circuits before being carried into the cabin.
In the hold as checked baggage:

If the Smart Baggage is to be checked in and will travel in the hold, the lithium battery/power bank must be removed and carried in the cabin with terminals insulated/protected against short circuit and protected from accidental activation.
If the Wh rating of the lithium battery/power bank is more than 160Wh, or the Wh rating cannot be determined (e.g. not marked on the battery/power bank case) the lithium battery/power bank will not be accepted on the flight.

Limits and charges

Some airports are restricted on their permissions to handle specific types of firearm – contact us to check
There is a limit of 5kg (11lb) of ammunition (cartridges for weapons) per person (IATA Division 1.4S; UN numbers 0012 and 0014). This is for that person’s own use only and excludes ammunition with explosive or incendiary projectiles.
Each bag or case containing firearms or ammunition is subject to a £125 charge each way, payable at check-in, plus applicable local service fees to cover the cost of our specialist firearms and ammunition handling partner.
If you take more or heavier bags than your checked baggage allowance, you will need to pay an extra charge.
How to pack your firearms and ammunition

Pack your firearms and ammunition together in an appropriate carriage case, or if this is not possible, securely inside your checked bag with your personal belongings (except to/from South Africa and Italy, and from Romania and Croatia).
Be aware that any bag packed with personal items as well as your firearm and/or ammunition must not contain liquids in containers over 100ml or other items prohibited in hand baggage, as it has to go through the hand baggage security checks.
If you're travelling to/from South Africa, Italy, or from Romania, check in your firearms and ammunition in individual locked cases, separate from any checked bag with your personal belongings. In this instance, you will not be charged an extra baggage fee for the separate ammunition case if you exceed your free baggage allowance.
When travelling from Croatia, firearms must be packed in a locked case, separate from ammunition and personal items that can be packed together in another locked case. In this instance, you will not be charged an extra bag fee for one of these cases if you go over your free checked baggage allowance. You will still need to pay the required firearm/ammunition fee for each case containing a firearm or ammunition and extra bag charges for any further bags that exceed your free checked bag allowance.
If you're travelling to/from the US, visit the TSA website for full details on transporting firearms and ammunition.
You cannot combine ammunition allowances for more than one person into one or more bags.
Ammunition needs to be in either its original packaging or a suitable container that prevents movement between shells or cartridges (loose ammunition is not permitted).
Make sure that firearms are unloaded and each firearm is accompanied by the appropriate certificate.
Do not use 'explosives' labels on bags with ammunition.
Arrive earlier for check-in

You must arrive at a check-in desk at least two hours before your flight to allow sufficient time to process the paperwork prior to clearing security. If you're travelling with 10 or more firearms or boxes of ammunition, you must allow at least three hours.

You must declare that you are travelling with firearms and/or ammunition at the check-in desk.

Connecting between different terminals at an airport

If you are connecting between different terminals at a UK airport, please allow at least three hours between flights.

Connecting between different airports

British Airways does not offer a connecting service for travelling with firearms between UK airports.

If you're connecting between different UK airports, you must ensure that you have the appropriate licences/permissions to be in possession of a firearm in the UK and you must make your own arrangements for the transfer of your firearms to your connecting flight. Please allow more than the recommended minimum connection time.

Party poppers and sparklers are not allowed on any British Airways’ aircraft in either hand baggage or checked hold baggage as they are classed as fireworks.

Sky lanterns, sometimes known as Chinese lanterns, are not allowed onto any British Airways’ aircraft in either your hand baggage or checked hold baggage as they contain a chemical pad that could ignite. They are banned in many countries.

You can carry one small packet of safety matches or a small cigarette lighter that does not contain unabsorbed liquid fuel other than liquefied gas on your person but not in your hand or checked baggage. These items need to be for personal use.

The empty fuel tank and/or fuel container must be allowed to drain for one hour. 
The fuel tank and/or fuel container must be left uncapped for six hours to allow any residual fuel to evaporate. If the tank smells of fuel, it cannot travel.
Alternative methods such as adding cooking oil to the fuel tank and/or fuel container to elevate the flashpoint of any residual fuel and then emptying the tank are also acceptable.
The empty fuel tank and/or fuel container must have the cap securely fastened and be wrapped in an absorbent material such as paper towel and placed in a polythene or equivalent bag. The top of the bag must be sealed or gathered and closed with an elastic band or twine.
For your convenience, you must pack a copy of this page with the fuel tank and/or fuel container to identify that you have our ‘operator approval’ to carry the camping stove.
You do NOT need to contact the airline or inform staff at the airport that you are carrying this item.
